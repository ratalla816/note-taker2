  ## Description
  
  AS A small business owner

  SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
  GIVEN a note-taking application

  THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
  WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
  THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
  WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
  THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
  WHEN I click on the Save icon 
  THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
  WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column

  * You can use the `-y` flag to skip the package questionnaire and leave default answers
  npm init -y.
  * You can use `npm i` as a shortcut for `npm install` npm i express.
  * Make sure to save the code, then stop the previous server (if you haven't stopped it already) by entering Ctrl+c and then Y at the prompt (if you are prompted), then run npm start to start the server again.
  * You should see this message in your terminal:
